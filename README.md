## Integration Guide

I do not have time to turn this lib into pods or SPM, for now, you can add this lib as a submodule

run the following command to add this repo as a submodule, by default, it will use `release` branch

`git submodule add git@github.com:oneHook/oneHookLibrarySwift.git`

run the following command if you wish to check any latest release/change

`git submodule update --remote --merge`

## Samples

open `oneHookLibrarySwift.xcodeproj` to run the samples

# Features

## Kotlin Style Code

Are you tired of write code like this?

```
var a = something()
a.value1 = 5
a.value2 = 6
a.value3 = 7
```

Me too!

Inspired by `Kotlin` now you can do this

```
var a = something().apply {
    $0.value1 = 5
    $0.value2 = 6
    $0.value3 = 7
}
```

or

```
var a = something()
a.also {
    $0.value1 = 5
    $0.value2 = 6
    $0.value3 = 7
}
```

this enable us to better group code like this

```
let label = UILabel().apply {
   $0.font = ...
   $0.text = ...
}
```

## Assets Script

Are you tired of getting assets/strings like this?

```
UIImage(named: "xxx")
NSLocalizedString("xxx", comment: "xxx")
```

Remember that time you wasted 2 hours on a spelling error? No? Ok fine, shame on you

now with the asserts script, once you set it up in build phase, it will generate swift code that does all that for you, now you only do 

```
UIImage(named: R.Images.xxx)
R.Strings.xxx
```

### Instruction

1. install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Create a new file and define a empty class R
3. Add a new run script to your target and use the following, replace the path with your own
4. Just run, code will be auto generated

```
COLOR_SCRIPT_LOCATION="${SRCROOT}/oneHookLibrary/Script/color_assets_script.py"
COLOR_ASSET_LOCATION="${SRCROOT}/Sample/Assets/Colors.xcassets"
DARK_COLOR_ASSET_LOCATION="${SRCROOT}/Sample/Assets/Colors.xcassets/DarkMode"
COLOR_CLASS_LOCATION="${SRCROOT}/Sample/Assets"

python3 ${COLOR_SCRIPT_LOCATION} ${COLOR_ASSET_LOCATION} ${DARK_COLOR_ASSET_LOCATION} ${COLOR_CLASS_LOCATION}

IMAGE_SCRIPT_LOCATION="${SRCROOT}/oneHookLibrary/Script/assets_script.py"
IMAGE_ASSETS_LOCATION="${SRCROOT}/Sample/Assets/Assets.xcassets"
IMAGE_CLASS_LOCATION="${SRCROOT}/Sample/Assets/ImageAssets.swift Image"

python3 ${IMAGE_SCRIPT_LOCATION} ${IMAGE_ASSETS_LOCATION} ${IMAGE_CLASS_LOCATION}
```

## Declarative UI Building

Do you want to use `SwiftUI` but don't want to lose 30% users?
Do you want to use `AutoLayout` but found it way too complicated for simple case?
Do you want to use `storyboard` but... No, nobody wants to use storyboard, it's shit

now you can build UI like this, the following code made a simple `UITableViewCell` with title/subtitle

```
class SimpleTableViewCell: SelectableTableViewCell {

    private let stackLayout = StackLayout().apply {
        $0.padding = Dimens.marginMedium
        $0.contentGravity = .centerVertical
        $0.orientation = .vertical
        $0.spacing = Dimens.marginMedium
    }

    let titleLabel = EDLabel().apply {
        $0.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 15)
        $0.textColor = .primaryTextColor
    }

    let subtitleLabel = EDLabel().apply {
        $0.font = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 12)
        $0.textColor = .primaryTextColor
    }

    override func commonInit() {
        super.commonInit()
        backgroundColor = .clear
        contentView.addSubview(stackLayout.apply {
            $0.addSubview(titleLabel)
            $0.addSubview(subtitleLabel)
        })
    }

    override func layoutSubviews() {
        super.layoutSubviews()
        stackLayout.matchParent()
    }

    override func sizeThatFits(_ size: CGSize) -> CGSize {
        stackLayout.sizeThatFits(size)
    }
}
```

## Layout Parameters

We extends all Views and Controls with layout parameters to work with our [layout classes](#layout-classes)

- `padding`  refers to the space between an element and the content inside it. 
- `margin` is the space around an element and 
- `layoutGravity` specifies how a view should be placed in its parent view
- `layoutSize` prefered size of this view, when it's provided, measured size will be ignored
- `layoutWeight` used by `LinearLayout` to determine the size ratio between muliple views.
- `shouldSkip` if set to true, layout classes will ignore this child

## Layout Classes

We introduced various layout view classes such as

- `LinearLayout` - basically `HStack` `VStack` in `SwiftUI`, layout children either horizontally and vertically and each child can decide its gravity 
- `FrameLayout` - layout multiple children by using `layoutGravity` from each child
- `FlowLayout` - puts children in a row, sized at their preferred size. If the horizontal space in the container is too small to put all the components in one row, the FlowLayout class uses multiple rows.
- `StackLayout` - Similar to LinearLayout, but always have specific spacing between two children.
- `EqualWeightLayout` - Layout each child with equal width, always distribute children in one row
- `GridLayout` - Layout children with equal width with given column count children per row
